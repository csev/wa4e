  "description": "In this assignment, you will extend our simple resume database to support Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for an Education table. This table has a many-to-one relationship with the Profile table and a many-to-one relationship with the Institution table. As a result, the Profile and Institution tables are linked through a many-to-many relationship via the Education table. Additionally, you will enhance the user interface by adding a jQuery autocomplete field for institutions.",
